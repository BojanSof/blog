Homelab is personal IT environment used for learning, experimenting and self-hosting services.
Personally, it allowed me to learn a lot of new things regarding networking, security, self-hosting applications and managing the whole environment.
In this blog post, I am going to describe my homelab, the process of creating it and some of the challenges I found during the development.

## How it all started

Earlier this year, I moved to new appartment.
While I was packing the boxes with stuff from the old appartment, I found old [FritzBox](https://fritz.com/en) all-in-one router and DSL modem in one of the storage shelves.
The specific model was [FritzBox 7360SL](https://boxmatrix.info/wiki/FRITZ!Box_Fon_WLAN_7360_SL).
To me such boxes like this are very fascinating because they are basically embedded Linux machines, which have potential to do a lot of other stuff beside their main purpose.
How cool it is to have VPN server to your home network running on the router itself!
Or blocking ads for the whole network!

I had experience with modding other FritzBox device - around 1 and a half year ago, I was trying to mod another FritzBox device to run [Freetz](https://freetz.github.io/)(the maintained fork of the project is [Freetz-NG](https://freetz-ng.github.io/freetz-ng/)) - firmware modifications for FritzBox which allows to run custom packages on the FritzBox, like VPN servers, HTTP servers, custom DNS, etc.
Also I'll use this opportunity to mention that there is a whole wiki page for FritzBox devices, [BoxMatrix](https://boxmatrix.info/wiki/BoxMatrix).
It contains a lot of technical details for many different FritzBox devices.
I had the fortune to colaborate with the maintainer of BoxMatrix, hippie2000, to get Freetz running on my FritzBox, from whom I learnt a lot of stuff regarding what it takes to mod and adapt linux configurations and modules.
Kudos to him!
I used this FritzBox device to run OpenVPN server to access the home network, and I was running [dnsmasq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq) with [Addhole](https://freetz-ng.github.io/freetz-ng/make/addhole/?h=addhole) extension, to block list of hostnames that contain ads, malwares, trackers and other unwanted things.
It also helped me learn about terms like [Dynamic DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS) and [DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)), and see how to practically use them.
But it wasn't the smoothest experience, as the hardware was a bit outdated and didn't have a lot of power.

Now going back to packing the FritzBox 7360SL, I made a quick google search on it, and I've noticed that [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) supports this device.
I always wanted to try OpenWRT, Linux targetting embedded devices, mainly handling networking tasks.
It is a great way to keep old equipment, unsupported by the manufacturer anymore, running with the latest Linux kernel version, security patches and bug fixes.
OpenWRT also has very big comprehensive package list.

After moving to the new appartment, I had some time and started playing with the FritzBox 7360SL.
I installed OpenWRT on it following [OpenWRT guide](https://openwrt.org/toh/avm/fritz.box.wlan.7360), I was amazed how many confiugrations and customizations were available in the Web UI, making the hardware feel so powerful.
Creating network interfaces, creating VLANs, managing firewall zones, looking at the enormous OpenWRT package list were things that opened the doors to many new learning opportunities.

Quickly after that, I got introduced to [Proxmox](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page) - server virtualization management solution based on QEMU/KVM and LXC (Linux Containers).
I bought myself cheap refurbished HP260 G2 mini PC, with i3-6100U 2-core/4-thread CPU, 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD.
It has a very small form-factor, making it easy to put it under table or in a corner.
I've installed Proxmox on it and started spinning out VMs and LXCs - Adguard Home for DNS, InfluxDB and Grafana for monitoring the PC, Nginx Reverse Proxy, host my WebRTC chat application, self-host Music library, and many more.

My latest update to the homelab equipment was [GL.iNet Flint 2](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt6000/), a high-performance router, which I got as gift for my birthday.
The Flint 2 is considered one of the best OpenWRT routers from many users - it has very power CPU (MediaTek Filogic 830, MT7986AV), 1 GB RAM and 8 GB eMMC, two 2.5 Gbit ports and four 1 Gbit ports, and USB 3.1 port.
It upgraded the FritzBox 7360SL device, which was behaving weirdly sometimes - WiFi was disconnecting and it was becoming unresponsive.
Now, the whole networks feels much smoother.
